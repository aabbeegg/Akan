# By **Beverly Njeri**
## Description
To be able to run this application all one needs to do is to put in the necessary details ie their year month and date of birth as well as their gender.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Navigate to the top level of the directory
* Open index.html in your browser
## Known Bugs
Luckily though for anyone interested in running this web application, there are currently no known bugs hence no major work arounds required.

However there maybe miscalculation in terms of dates, (though on very rare occassions.) hence not very accurate results are acquired.
## Technologies Used
{HTML[Hyper Text Markup Language] is largely incorporated here in this IP as well as a bit of CSS[Cascading Style Sheets] which has helped me make the IP's layout less plain.Am not very conversant with the Bootstrap technology yet so I decided to avoid using it at this point for now.}
